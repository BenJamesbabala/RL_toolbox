# RL_toolbox
## all the algorithm is running on pycharm IDE, or the package loss error may exist.

## implemented algorithm: trpo a3c
* a3c:for continous action space, use multi processes, but saving model has not been implemented.
* trpo:for continous and discrete action space

## run
* a3c:run a3c/a3c_continous.py in pycharm IDE
* trpo:run experiment/trpo_continous.py in pycharm IDE

## contain some useful reinforcement learning algorithm and relative tool
